   Replacement tool for creative building (Mod for MineTest)

This tool is helpful for creative purposes (i.e. build a wall and "paint" windows into it).
It replaces nodes with a previously selected other type of node (i.e. places said windows
into a brick wall).

Crafting:   chest  -      -
            -      stick  -
            -      -      chest
Or just use /giveme replacer:replacer

Usage: Right-click on a node of that type you want to replace other nodes with.
       Left-click (normal usage) on any nodes you want to replace with the type you previously right-clicked on.
       Sneak-Right-click (alternatively: aux1-Right-click) in order to store a new pattern.

When in creative mode, the node will just be replaced. Your inventory will not be changed.

When not in creative mode, digging will be simulated and you will get what was there. In return, the replacement node
will be taken from your inventory.


The second tool included in this mod is the inspector.

Crafting:    torch
             stick

Just wield it and click on any node or entity you want to know more about. A limited craft-guide is included.
